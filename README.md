TicTacToe
=========

Also known as Ultimate Tic Tac Toe, where each cell in a typical Tic Tac Toe grid is taken by winning a smaller grid inside it.
Rules:
- The position in the small grid that a player selects determines in which small grid the other player must play. For instance, if Player 1 fills in the middle cell of the top-left grid, Player 2 must next play anywhere in the middle grid.
- If the grid that a player is supposed to play in is already completed, the player may choose any grid to play in
- If a grid is tied, then nobody gets it
